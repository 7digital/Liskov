The Liskov Substitution Principle


If for each object o1 of type S there is an object o2 of type T such that for all
programs P defined in terms of T, the behavior of P is unchanged when o1 is
substituted for o2 then S is a subtype of T.

FUNCTIONS THAT USE POINTERS OR REFERENCES TO BASE
CLASSES MUST BE ABLE TO USE OBJECTS OF DERIVED CLASSES
WITHOUT KNOWING IT.
